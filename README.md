# Triangle Validator v1.0

This is a simple triangle validator I made in Bash.  
I wrote it to practice using **if** and **while** statements.

It asks the user to enter three side lengths and checks if they can form a valid triangle.  
If the inputs aren’t numbers, it will ask again until valid numbers are entered.

In the future, I plan to make the code cleaner by using functions and maybe add some extra features to make it more interesting.
